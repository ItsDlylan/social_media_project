PROJECT TODOS 

A social media site where you can add a user, and a user can add posts, with comments on those posts. 

You should store all the users in an array.

All of a users posts should be stored in a posts array for that user

Each post should be an object with an id, title, content, and an array for comments. 

You will need endpoints to add a user,add a post to a user's list of posts, add a comment to a post, delete a comment, delete a post, delete a user, update a user, post or comment. 

How many endpoints you have and what exactly each one does is up to you. The purpose of this exercise is for you to try and plan and create a front to back end project from scratch. All of the design decisions for the front end and the back end are up to you.
